# malanalysis
Static/Dynamic analysis reports on various malware samples.

## My Setup

All malware samples are analyzed inside a `Windows 10 Home` virtual machine, with updates and windows defender turned off using [WPD](https://wpd.app/). Also a [remnux](https://remnux.org/) machine is used along with the windows machine to build an internal network within virtualbox.

## Purpose

I like malware analysis, so this repository is just for fun, and documenting my analysis, and also to help those who want to learn malware analysis, by reading easy-to-understand reports.
